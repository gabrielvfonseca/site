## Performance Issue Description
A clear and concise description of the performance problem or optimization opportunity.

## Performance Impact
- What is slow or inefficient?
- How does this affect user experience?
- What is the expected vs. actual performance?

## Environment
- Environment: [e.g., Development, Staging, Production]
- Version: [e.g., v1.2.3]
- Platform: [e.g., Web, Mobile, Desktop]
- Browser: [e.g., Chrome v130, Safari, Firefox] (if applicable)
- Device: [e.g., Desktop, Mobile, Tablet]

## Performance Metrics
- Response time: [e.g., 5 seconds]
- Load time: [e.g., 10 seconds]
- Memory usage: [e.g., 500MB]
- CPU usage: [e.g., 80%]
- Network requests: [e.g., 50 requests]

## Steps to Reproduce
1. 
2. 
3. 

## Current Performance
Describe the current performance characteristics.

## Expected Performance
Describe what performance you expect to see.

## Additional Context
- Performance profiling results
- Screenshots of performance tools
- Logs or metrics
- Any recent changes that might have caused this
