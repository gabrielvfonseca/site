# Release Management

This document outlines the release management process, versioning strategy, and deployment procedures for gabfon.com.

## Versioning Strategy

### Semantic Versioning (SemVer)

We follow [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) for all packages and applications:

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[-PRERELEASE][+BUILD]
```

#### Version Components

- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes, incompatible API changes
- **MINOR**: New features, backward-compatible additions
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes, backward-compatible patches
- **PRERELEASE**: Alpha, beta, or release candidate versions
- **BUILD**: Build metadata (optional)

#### Examples

```bash
# Stable releases
1.0.0          # Initial release
1.2.3          # Minor feature + patch
2.0.0          # Major breaking change

# Prereleases
1.2.0-alpha.1  # Alpha version
1.2.0-beta.2   # Beta version
1.2.0-rc.1     # Release candidate

# Build metadata
1.2.3+build.123
1.2.3+sha.abc123
```

### Monorepo Versioning

#### Independent Versioning

Each package and application can have independent versions:

```json
// package.json
{
  "name": "gabfon",
  "version": "0.1.0"
}

// apps/site/package.json
{
  "name": "site",
  "version": "0.1.0"
}
```

#### Synchronized Versioning

For coordinated releases, all packages can use the same version:

```bash
# Update all packages to same version
pnpm version 2.0.0 --workspace

# Update specific packages
pnpm version 2.0.0 --filter=@gabfon/design-system
pnpm version 2.0.0 --filter=@gabfon/analytics
```

## Release Process
