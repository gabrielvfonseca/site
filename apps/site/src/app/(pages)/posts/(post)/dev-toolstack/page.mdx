# Apps and Tools I use daily

I've been building (<i>complexier</i>) software over 6 years and have 
experimented with a variety of tools and technologies. 
Here's a detailed look into the software and tools I use daily:

### Always with me
- Macbook Pro M1 Max 16" (2020)
- iPhone 13 

### Productivity

- **Note-taking**: I use [Notion](https://notion.so) for 
    organizing my thoughts, tasks, and projects.

- **Task Management**: I still rely on [Notion](https://notion.so) 
    for managing my daily tasks and projects.

    for managing my calendar and scheduling events.

    distracting websites and apps during work hours.

### Development Tools

- **Code Editor**: I use [Cursor](https://code.visualstudio.com)
    for all types of development tasks. It's fast, extensible, and integrates with AI.

- **Terminal**: It may sound old-school, but I prefer the macOS default 
    Terminal for most of my command-line tasks.

    for building accessible and responsive UI components.

### Backend Development

- **Server**: I work with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 
    for server-side development.

    for relational databases.

    [Azure](https://www.azure.com),
    and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com)
