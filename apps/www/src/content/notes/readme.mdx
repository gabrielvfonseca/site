I've build this website in less than two days with a clear goal in mind: 
to create a personal space on the internet where I could share my thoughts, 
showcase my work, and connect with like-minded individuals. 
Here's a detailed look into how I brought this vision to life:

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: I opted for 
<a href='https://nextjs.org' target='_blank'>Next.js</a>, a 
powerful React framework that offers server-side rendering, automatic 
code splitting, and easy deployment. Its versatility and performance 
optimizations make it ideal for building modern web applications.

- **UI Design**: The user interface is crafted using 
<a href='https://ui.shadcn.com' target='_blank'>ui.shadcn</a>, 
a sophisticated UI library that enhances aesthetics and user 
experience with its modern design principles and component variety.

- **Typography**: The website utilizes 
<a href='https://rsms.me/inter/' target='_blank'>Inter</a>,
a versatile sans-serif font designed for optimal readability on 
digital screens. Its open-source nature and aesthetic appeal 
make it a perfect choice for enhancing content presentation.

### Backend Setup

- **Markdown**: I've integrated 
<a href='https://contentlayer.dev/' target='_blank'>Contentlayer</a>,
a content SDK that enables me to manage and update website content
seamlessly using Markdown files. This simplifies content management
and allows me to focus on creating engaging content without worrying
about complex backend setups.

- **Email**: I've implemented <a href='https://resend.com/' target='_blank'>Resend</a>, 
a email platform crafted for developers, to handle email subscriptions and
notifications. This ensures reliable email delivery and seamless
integration with my website's backend.

### Infrastructure

- **Hosting**: The website is securely hosted on <a href='https://vercel.com' target='_blank'>Vercel</a>, 
a platform known for its seamless deployment workflow, automatic scaling, 
and global CDN support. This ensures fast loading times and reliable 
performance across different regions.

- **Domain**: My personalized domain is managed through AWS 
<a href='https://aws.amazon.com/route53' target='_blank'>Route 53</a>, ensuring robust DNS
management and reliable routing to my website's servers.

### Analytics

- **Analytics**: The website utilizes [Posthog](https://posthog.com), an 
open-source product analytics platform that provides valuable 
insights into user behavior, engagement metrics, and content 
performance. This data-driven approach helps me optimize the 
website for better user experiences.
